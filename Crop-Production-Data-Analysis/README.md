# India-Crop-Production-Data-Analysis
India is an agricultural country, with around 60% of its population engaged in the industry, either directly or indirectly. This sector contributes approximately 18% to the country's total GDP.

# Motivation

With a population nearing 1.5 billion, India faces the critical challenge of ensuring sufficient food production to meet the needs of its people. This thought led me to explore the countryâ€™s agricultural capacity, with rainfall being a key factor influencing crop production. Therefore, I have included rainfall data to better understand its impact on India's ability to feed its population.
